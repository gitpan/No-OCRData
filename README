This package deals with files that can be retrieved from Norwegian 
banks, if you have proper agreements. In the good old days, these 
files were generated mostly by scanning and OCRing paper, and for 
that reason the service is still called "OCRGiro". The data 
I've operated on has hardly been OCRed, but that is what they 
to date emphasize... 

The rest of the documentation is written in Norwegian, as I suspect 
this module is of very little use if you do not read the language.
